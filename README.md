# SQL Final Project

## Course: SQL  
### Final Project Problem Statement

This repository contains the final project for the SQL course.  
The project demonstrates fundamental SQL concepts using PostgreSQL/Redshift, including:  
- Creating databases and tables  
- Inserting and manipulating data  
- Querying and filtering data  
- Aggregating and analyzing data  
- Data manipulation and transformation  

By completing the below tasks, a solid foundation is built in working with databases, which is essential for roles in data management, software development, and data analysis.
